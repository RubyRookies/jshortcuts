### What is it?

This repository is intended to serve as shortcuts and tips for JavaScript beginner.

It is really intended to be a notes & practice and tidbits to help myself while reading JS materials.

For example, I'll pick up a helper function like 'integer' (which doesn't exist in JavaScript) while reading Doug Crockford's book __JavaScript: The Good Parts__. I wanted to capture the method as well as practice augmenting types, which was the point of the section.

### Why do it?

Because it is good to practice, and also as a way to remember some key pieces learned. 

It's all about the DRY principle. Don't reapeat yourself. It's good to have something to look back on. Especially as I'm getting old and losing memory.
